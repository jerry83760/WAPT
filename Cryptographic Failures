Description:
The incorrect use or implementation of cryptographic protocols and algorithms. This can include using weak or outdated encryption algorithms, improper key management, lack of sufficient randomness.
These failures can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets.

Impact:
• Compromised Data: Sensitive information may be exposed or stolen.
• Loss of Trust: Users’ trust in the application or service can be severely damaged.
• Regulatory Penalties: Non-compliance with data protection laws can result in hefty fines.
• Security Breaches: Weaknesses in cryptography can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems

Prevention:
• Strong Encryption: Use strong and current encryption algorithms to protect data in transit and at rest.
• Key Management: Implement robust key management practices, including key rotation and secure key storage.
• Randomness: Ensure that cryptographic randomness requirements are met to strengthen the encryption.
• Authentication: Properly authenticate parties in a cryptographic exchange to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
• Regular Updates: Stay updated with the latest cryptographic standards and best practices to avoid dependence on obsolete methods

List of vulns:
Use of Hard-coded Password (CWE-259): This involves the use of hard-coded passwords, which can be easily discovered and exploited.
Broken or Risky Crypto Algorithm (CWE-327): This refers to the use of weak or broken cryptographic algorithms that can be easily cracked.
Insufficient Entropy (CWE-331): This occurs when the randomness used for cryptographic purposes does not meet the required cryptographic standards.
Weak Encryption: Using an encryption algorithm no longer considered secure, such as DES or RSA with a small key size, can make it relatively easy for an attacker to decrypt the information.
Improper Key Management: Failing to protect or rotate encryption keys adequately can compromise sensitive information.
Inadequate Randomness: Some cryptographic algorithms, such as generating session keys, require a source of valid random numbers. Using a Pseudo Random Number Generator instead can weaken the encryption.
Inadequate Authentication: Failing to authenticate parties properly in a cryptographic exchange can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts and alters communications.
Dependence on Obsolete Standards: Such as SSL V2 and SSL V3, which had critical vulnerabilities exploited in the wild.
