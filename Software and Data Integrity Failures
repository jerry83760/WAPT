Software and Data Integrity Failures

Description:
These vulnerabilities relate to code and infrastructure lacking protection against integrity violations.
For instance, applications relying on plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources or repositories are at risk.
Insecure CI/CD pipelines can introduce unauthorized access or malicious code.
Auto-updates without sufficient integrity verification can allow attackers to distribute and run their own updates.

Impact:
• Unauthorized Modification: Attackers can alter data or code, compromising system integrity.
• Data Exposure: Sensitive information may be accessed or tampered with.
• System Compromise: Malicious code introduced via insecure pipelines can compromise the entire system

Prevention:
• Digital Signatures: Verify software/data from expected sources using digital signatures.
• Trusted Repositories: Use trusted repositories for libraries and dependencies.
• Code Review: Minimize malicious code by reviewing changes.
• CI/CD Security: Ensure proper segregation, configuration, and access control in pipelines.
• Integrity Checks: Don’t send unsigned or unencrypted serialized data to untrusted clients
 
List of vulns:
• CI/CD Pipeline
• Insecure Disposal
• Compromised Pre-installed Software
