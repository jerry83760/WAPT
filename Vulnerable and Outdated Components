Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Description:
Vulnerable and outdated components refer to software libraries, frameworks, or other third-party components that have known security vulnerabilities or are no longer actively maintained. These components can be found in various parts of a software system, including the operating system, web/application servers, databases, and client-side libraries

Impact:
• Security Breaches: Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or take control of the system.
• System Instability: Outdated components may not be compatible with newer software, leading to crashes or other operational issues.
• Compliance Issues: Using unsupported software can lead to non-compliance with industry regulations and standards.

Prevention:
• Patch Management: Regularly update and patch all components. Implement a process to ensure timely updates1.
• Inventory Management: Maintain an inventory of all software components, including their versions and dependencies1.
• Vulnerability Scanning: Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk to scan for known vulnerabilities in your components14.
• Secure Sources: Only download components from official and secure sources. Prefer signed packages to reduce the risk of tampered components1.
• Monitoring and Alerts: Subscribe to security bulletins and alerts for the components you use to stay informed about new vulnerabilities
 
List of vulns:
• Unpatched Libraries: Libraries like jQuery, AngularJS, or ReactJS that have known vulnerabilities but haven’t been updated1.
• Outdated Frameworks: Web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django, or Spring that are not updated to the latest secure versions1.
• Operating System Vulnerabilities: Unpatched vulnerabilities in operating systems, such as the Windows SMB vulnerability (EternalBlue)1.
• Web Server Vulnerabilities: Outdated versions of web servers like Apache or IIS that have known security issues1.
• Database Management Systems: Vulnerabilities in outdated versions of database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL2.
• Third-Party Components: Use of unmaintained third-party components that may have security flaws2.
• Nested Dependencies: Vulnerabilities in nested dependencies that are not directly visible but are part of the software stack
