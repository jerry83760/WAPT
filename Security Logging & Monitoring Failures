Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

Description:
Security logging and monitoring failures occur when an application’s ability to log security-related events and effectively monitor those logs falls short. These shortcomings can lead to delayed detection of security incidents, making it easier for attackers to remain undetected.

Impact:
• Breaches may remain undetected, allowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
• Delayed response increases the risk of data compromise and system damage.

Prevention:
• Log login failures, access control issues, and input validation failures.
• Use log formats compatible with log management solutions.
• Encode log data correctly to prevent attacks.
• Establish an audit trail for critical transactions.
• Set up effective monitoring and alerting mechanisms.
• Have an incident response plan in place.
 
List of vulns:
• Insufficient logging: Failing to log relevant security events.
• Unclear log messages: Logs lacking context or meaningful information.
• Lack of monitoring: Inadequate surveillance of logs for suspicious activity.
• Ineffective response processes: Delays in detecting and responding to incidents.
• Improper output neutralization for logs: Vulnerabilities related to log data.
• Omission of security-relevant information: Missing critical details in logs.
