Identification and Authentication Failures

Description:
These vulnerabilities occur when a system or application fails to correctly identify or authenticate a user.
Attackers exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to systems and data.

Impact:
• Unauthorized Access: Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms, gaining entry to sensitive resources.
• Data Exposure: Sensitive data may be exposed due to weak authentication controls.
• Session Hijacking: Attackers can take over active user sessions.
• Brute Force Attacks: Repeated login attempts can compromise accounts.
• Credential Stuffing: Attackers reuse stolen credentials across multiple services

Prevention:
• Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent automated attacks.
• Avoid shipping or deploying with default credentials (especially for admin users).
• Enforce strong password policies based on modern guidelines (e.g., NIST 800-63b).
• Harden registration, credential recovery, and API pathways against account enumeration attacks.
• Limit failed login attempts without causing denial of service.
• Use secure, server-side session management with random session IDs and proper invalidation.
