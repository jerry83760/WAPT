Description:
Broken Access Control is a security issue where a system fails to properly restrict the activities that authenticated users are allowed to perform. 
This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functions beyond the userâ€™s permissions.

Impact:
a. Data Breach: Unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to data theft or leakage.
b. Functionality Misuse: Users performing actions outside of their intended permissions, potentially causing operational disruptions.
c. Elevation of Privilege: Attackers gaining higher-level privileges, which could lead to full system compromise.

Prevention:
a. Least Privilege Principle: Users should only have the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.
b. Access Control Lists (ACLs): Implementing ACLs to define who can access what resources in the system.
c. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigning permissions based on roles within the organization.
d. Regular Audits: Conducting regular security audits to ensure access controls are working as intended.
e. Automated Testing: Using automated tools to test for access control issues during development and deployment.
